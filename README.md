# Mastermind
This game is a Unity remake of the popular board game Mastermind. Mastermind is a game featuring a code maker and code breaker. The code breaker has 8-12 turns to guess the 4 color code the codemaker makes. There are 6 colors total. With each guess, the codemaker gives feedback in the form of white/black pegs. No peg means the color is not in the code at all. A white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong position in the code. A black peg indicates a correct color and position.

It features colored peg selection, a feedback system, a title screen, and an end screen (win or lose). The feedback system includes white and black pegs to the right and left of the player's guess to tell them how close they were to cracking the code.

The colored peg selection is in front of the player. To select a colored peg, right click on the colored panel in front of the player. Once you have selected 4 colors, select the black colored panel. This will cause the pegs to move forward and white/black pegs to appear next to each, or none could appear. 

To exit the game, hit 'END' on your keyboard.
